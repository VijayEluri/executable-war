Executable War
==============

Taking ideas from Hudson and Google Gerrit, this project aims at providing
a relatively easy way for developers to make WAR files self-runnable,
while still deployable to a standard servlet container.

To achieve this goal, we provide a sample Maven recipe that a developer
can use, and a launcher class that will take care of making direct
execution of the WAR possible.

To find out more, please see the Javadoc pages.  You can also read about 
this project at http://jean-francois.richard.name/.
